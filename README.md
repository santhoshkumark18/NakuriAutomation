## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**: Don't run too frequently to avoid account restrictions
2. **Account Safety**: Monitor for any unusual account activity
3. **Resume Updates**: Keep your resume file updated in the repository
4. **Location Logic**: Currently toggles Chennai; modify logic for other cities if needed

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

2. **Resume Not Found**: Verify resume path and file exists
3. **Element Not Found**: Naukri might have changed their UI - update selectors
4. **Workflow Not Running**: Check cron syntax and GitHub Actions permissions

### Debug Steps:

2. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify all secrets are properly set
4. Test with manual workflow trigger first
